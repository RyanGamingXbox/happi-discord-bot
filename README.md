## Description

A discord bot I work on my free time. It's meant to be more of a general purpose bot for
moderation, voice and more. This is just a small side project, so don't expect that much 
from it.

### ðŸ“š Dependencies
- [Discord.js](discord.js.org) is a library for interacting with the Discord API.
    - [Sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium), [YTDL-Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core), [@discordjs/opus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/opus) and [ffmpeg-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) are voice dependencies.
- [Colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors) and [Beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beautify) are purely cosmetic libraries that are used for other features of the bot.
